# Search Everything
This is a simple C# application to search for directories, files and the contents of files. Born out of a frustration at Windows' sub-par search functionality, and a healthy dose of hubris.

It may be better than Windows' built-in functionality, but there are tons of better applications out there. I would generally recommend you use those instead.

These all have the significant downside of not being written by me though.

Now I could take the time and learn one of these better tools, or I could be a stubborn sod and write something myself, and insist on using that instead.

Guess which option I went for.
